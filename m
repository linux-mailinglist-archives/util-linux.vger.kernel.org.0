Subject: [PATCH 1/2] Manual pages: wording fix: "another" ==> "other"
Date:   Fri, 29 May 2020 14:20:47 +0200
Message-Id: <20200529122048.1052198-1-mtk.manpages@gmail.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.26.2
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Sender: util-linux-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <util-linux.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: util-linux@vger.kernel.org

In several pages, there is a consistent wording problem: "another"
where "other" should be used. This wording problem can be
surprisingly confusing for native speakers, especially those
unaware that in some other languages, "another" and "other" can be
expressed with the same word.
