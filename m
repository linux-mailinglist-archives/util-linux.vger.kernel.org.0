I'd like to write something like "mountsh" one day. The idea is to
have very low-level tool that is able to provide command line
interface to the all fragments of the new mount API in the same
granularity as provided by kernel (mount(8) is too high-level in this
case).

Anyway, the primary goal is to use the new syscalls on standard
places (e.g. libmount) where it improves performance.

or more filesystems mounted on the same mountpoint, mountpoint is
deleted, etc...
