OK, I have implemented it, but frankly, I'm not sure about it ;-) 
I have added William to CC:, maybe he will come with comments.  
       
See https://github.com/karelzak/util-linux/tree/topic/hwclock-drift-file
branch.                                                    
       
The idea is to keep /etc/adjtime as a source for UTC/LOCAL flag, but   
hwclock drift info (which we need to update occasionally) move to    
/var/lib/hwclock/drift. The /etc/adjtime is de-facto standard and
move it means that 3rd party utils will have no way how to determine 
hwclock UTC/LOCAL mode.
       
Both files use "adjtime" file format to make it simple to convert
from one to another.                                         
       
The change should be backwardly compatible. If you do not have /var/lib/hwclock/drift 
then it falls back to /etc/adjtime.                                  
       
I'm not sure if this is not over-engineering. Maybe the current
solution is good enough, and all we need is to make it more
use-friendly to set ADJTIME_PATH for users like Bruce (although
maintain any status information in /etc (in the year 2021) is not
nice.


The another possibility is to make a real change. Introduce completely
new file in /etc (/etc/clockmode) with only UTC/LOCAL(, force all
applications to use it (I know about rtcwake and systemd), and keep
/var/lib/hwclock/drift as private hwclock(1) file in a private format.
