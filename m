Can't we use getdate(3), instead? I see some advantages in this approach:

- It's a POSIX standard
- It's supported by GLIBC, uClibc-ng and musl, among others
- No need to maintain the code, since it is provided by the system libc
- It's easy to a default template to use if DATEMSK is not defined
(e.g. start with a copy of NetBSD's
/usr/share/examples/getdate/datemsk.template and expand it as
necessary).

Being non-reentrant is irelevant for hwclock and the cost of reading
an external file is negligible.
