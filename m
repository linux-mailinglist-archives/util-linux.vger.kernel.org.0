     not required, but thought it might allow for more types of
tests/usages.
If it is really of limited or no benefit, I'm not gonna lose sleep.

I get that....this wasn't intended as an 'endpoint' just a way for those
not
implementing and using the calls to get a feel for the call.Â  It may
not serve
a useful purpose in this case, but some system calls have direct
user-utils that
are very useful.Â  The lack of a system util to manipulate the pty calls
forced
me to write a few-line 'C' prog just to make 1 call to approve
something.Â  Eventually switched to a more robust interface in perl.

  No basic testing that the kernel call is producing exactly what you are
expecting is needed, I take it.

  That wasn't what I meant -- just that if you implement functionality in
a test prog, eventually you would be able to library-ize the call for other
purposes.Â  I got the impression th

    That sounds like a deficiency in the way mount tables are displayed.

Just like you can look at all net-io with a device name in column 0,
there's another directory where each device is a filename entry and by
looking at that
you can just look at the stats of that 1 file.

Block devices have the same type of all-or-single readouts as well.

So why not mounts?

I.e. why not subdirs for 'by-mountpoint', or by-device, or
whole-dev-vs.partition, or by UUID....like some things are listed
in /dev.  That would allow you to narrow in on the mount you want for
doing whatever.

The advantage of putting it in proc is that everyone easily benefits in a
portable, and easy to read interface, where-as binary-interfaces are what
make windows windows, with text interfaces on linux allowing for easy
prototyping and creative usages.

Just this one part -- of wanting a kernel call just to narrow scope
seems like a
perfect reason to add different ways of addressing mounts by different
keywords.
