Subject: [bugreport] "hwclock -w" reset time instead of setting the right time

"hwclock -w" reset time instead of setting the right time on M/B "ROG
Strix X570-I Gaming"
Demonstration: https://youtu.be/QRB7ZLiEfrc
Some DE like GNOME has automatic time synchronization option and there
is a feeling that hardware time reset after each Linux boot.
