The same problem are --output <columns> we use in many tools. The
solution is hardcoded limit. It's usually 2 times number of the all
possible items.

I think add

     struct dmesg_control {
     ...
        int     timefmts[2 * __DMESG_NTIMEFMTS];
        size_t  ntimefmts;
     }


would be enough. In the getopt_long() loop you can compare ntimefmts
with ARRAY_SIZE(ctl->timefmts) to check for the hardcoded limit (or
introduce a new function add_timefmt() to hide the detail).

Well, option like --ctime is alias to --time-format ctime, so if we
will support multiple --time-format, then

    dmesg --ctime --time-format delta

is the same as 

    dmesg --time-format ctime --time-format delta

It means two add_timefmt() calls in both cases.

And if there is a conflict, then --time-format should be the winner,
or don't support the interaction.

It's fine to define conflict between command line options. See
ul_excl_t excl[], there is already defined that you cannot use --raw
with something else.

Sounds too complicated. It's better to be strict and easy to explain :-)

Keep it simple and stupid ;-)
