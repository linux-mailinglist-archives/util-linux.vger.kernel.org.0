  No reason to give up.
Comment the font-escape line and
add the font-macro line after it.
People need to see the difference easily.

  My pointing to reference [1] is wrong,
as there is no instruction about using a macro
instead of a font escape request.

  Showing the commented out font-escape line is better,
so that the reader sees the difference and
how the transformation is made.
  The commented old line should come first
to prepare the user for the changed (maybe strange) line.

than using a quotation (", ").
