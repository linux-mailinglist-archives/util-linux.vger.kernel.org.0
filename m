Good to hear, thanks for the reply.

Read the document, or just the diff:

  https://author-tools.ietf.org/diff?doc_1=3Drfc4122&doc_2=3Ddraft-ietf-uui=
drev-rfc4122bis-02

Email uuidrev@ietf.org ... we are especially interested in whether we have
left out/obsoleted some use case that you presently have, whether the new
version types are useful to you.
Do you use or care about MD5 or SHA1 based UUIDs?
We have proposed using namespace based UUIDs for future hash methods.

No, I think that if you had a new use case/need, you'd have implemented
something already :-)
