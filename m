Greetings to you my name is Mrs. Marie Dzanis. I have an important 
information to share with you. is in relation to your name that matches 
the

name of a deceased customer of our bank (Northern Trust Bank) and his 
unclaimed Money. For security reasons, I am Mrs. Marie Dzanis MA, BA

(Hons) The head of EMEA for Northern Trust Asset Management and I 
oversee the governance, operations, business development and talent of

Northern Trust Asset Management. I received a notice last week from the 
General Headquarter of my bank to provide the next of kin to my late

client who shares the same with you, as his personal accountant. Failure 
to provide a said next of kin to my client will risk a transfer of the

funds to the Government (Escheat) in 21 days time. I am contacting you 
to assist me in repatriating the funds left behind by my late client as 
you

share the same surname with him. This claim will be executed without 
breaching any United Kingdom laws and success is guaranteed if we co-

operate on this. The bank will release the account to you because of my 
recommendation of you as the next of kin to the deposit as a member of

the family.
(inquiryersection@gmail.com) I will wait for your answer.Â 

Thanks and best regards
Marie Dzanis
