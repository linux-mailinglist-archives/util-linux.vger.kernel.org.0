Oh, that's a little disappointing. Archlinux has libmagic in core
repository and that lead me thinking it is quite likely part of even
most minimal installation, but apparently I was wrong.

Funny you said that. The more(1) movements are still quite disappointing
when trying to read the code. Sometime before Christmas I will try to
address that along with adding posix required more(1) key-bindings.
But there is no hope these would be ready before next util-linux release
so now we have a little unexpected movements for a bit. I hope that
is still an improvement to earlier situation when going backwards
seemed to be impossible for most of the users.

Thank you for review and merge Karel.
