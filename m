Hi,

Can you have a look at this again? My opinion here is we cannot reliably 
tell "core(s) per socket" or "socket(s)" which belongs to a CPU type 
because we do not know what separates CPU types.

For example, if you have different CPUs on different sockets, it makes 
sense to provide "core(s) per socket" and "socket(s)" values for each 
CPU type. However, if a CPU on a socket has a few clusters with 
different CPU types, they do not make sense. Of course we can have 
"core(s) per cluster" and "cluster(s)" values for each CPU type in such 
a case, but determining what distinguishes CPU types (cluster or socket, 
or possibly even something else?) introduces more complexity.

However I'm recently wondering if completely removing topology 
information from CPU types is not ideal either. Perhaps each CPU type 
can have a new value, "CPU(s) list" as the NUMA section does. It will 
not tell about topology as much as the current topology information tied 
with CPU types does, but you need something like "lscpu 
-p=CPU,Core,Cluster,Socket" for complete topological information even 
now. A CPU list is not confusing at least and concise.

It also allows to associate the CPU type information in the summary with 
the output of "lscpu -p=CPU,Core,Cluster,Socket". This information is 
also useful to run taskset to bind a process to a specific CPU type and 
e.g. to compare performance of big and LITTLE cores.

Akihiko Odaki
