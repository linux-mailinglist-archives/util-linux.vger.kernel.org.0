Since v2.27 we use this patch:
https://github.com/karelzak/util-linux/commit/acb7651f8897ae73d0f45dd75bc87630001c61b9

to ignore misaligned optimal I/O size, so the question is why your
fdisk follows 65535 (it would be nice to have output from 
"LIBFDISK_DEBUG=all fdisk -l <device>").

Anyway, you can move begin of the first partition in expert menu ('x')
by command 'b'.

It's also possible to use --sector-size, this option overrides logical
and physical sector size, and internally used io-size.

It would be possible to add --set-io-{min,opt,...} command line
options, I'll think about it but it's Pandora's box...

The problem is that the rest of the system (mkfs, LUKS, DM/lvm, ...)
still see wrong IO limits. The right way is to fix kernel.
