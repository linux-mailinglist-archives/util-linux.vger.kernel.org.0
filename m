Subject: [PATCH 7/7] Various manual pages: use the term "exit status"
Message-ID: <528e4b67-68e1-b3e3-01e3-83f395943b4b@gmail.com>

The manual pages currently use a multitude of terms--"exit code",
"error code", "return code", "exit code", and so on--when what
is always meant is "exit status" (the POSIX term). This patch fixes
as many of these erroneous terms as I could find.
