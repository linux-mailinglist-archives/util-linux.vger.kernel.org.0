On Mageia, run isodumper. It asks if you want to create a persistant
partition. Tell it to put a persistent  partition of of 2GB or so to fill u=
p
the usb. Now you will have a 2GB partition on the usb that you can write to
etc. It will I believe be ext4 by default although you can choose others. N=
o
need for fdisk. As has been stated this is not something that fdisk is
designed for. If you want to fix it so it will do what you want, you are of
course free to do so. Otherwise it is far simpler to use a tool that does w=
hat
you want already.

I suspect that isodumper would also work on other linux versions, but do no=
t
know for sure. It is a Python based program, so you would need the appropri=
ate
version of Python installed (or just install Mageia :-). Maybe Debian could
import it.

Of course it would then be irrelevant for=20

It is recommended to wipe the device with wipefs(8) or fdisk --wipe, in ord=
