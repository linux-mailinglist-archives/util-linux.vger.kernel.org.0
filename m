The tests are designed for smart people, like you who, are able to debug it ;-)

The --parallel=1 is the default when you execute ./run.sh from command
line. This is the way I usually use the tests. The "make check"
executes it in parallel to make it faster for automated execution
(github actions, travis, random QA, etc.)

Sounds good. Please, send patch.

For 3rd party programs you need "ts_check_prog <progname>" at the
beginning of the test.

It's definitely important to run the tests in more environments to
make it stable and I'm happy that we have contributors from
non-mainstream distributions.

So, thanks for your feedback.
