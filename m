Hi,

Is there any idea on resolving this issue?  What would be the best
way to prevent a session running inside screen from being
unexpectedly ended by script when the ssh connection to the server
is lost?

I'd like to find the best approach before coding a solution.  The
ideas I've had include:
* simply skipping sending the EOF to the child
* killing the child
* enabling the bash option that requires pressing CTRL-D more than
   once to exit (which seems ugly to me)
* researching for some other solution I'm not aware of yet

Please advise,
Dyweni
