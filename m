That defeats the purpose of this change. You cannot use the option with
old blkid, so using the option is broken and not using it is also broken.

If some random program using libblkid closes the tray I don't care that
much. However, many system scripts use blkid, probably to find a device
with particular ID:

/usr/bin/dracut:            dev=$(blkid -l -t UUID=${dev#UUID=} -o
device)
/usr/bin/dracut:            dev=$(blkid -l -t LABEL=${dev#LABEL=} -o
device)
/usr/bin/dracut:            dev=$(blkid -l -t PARTUUID=${dev#PARTUUID=}
-o device)
/usr/bin/dracut:            dev=$(blkid -l -t
PARTLABEL=${dev#PARTLABEL=} -o device)

/usr/bin/linux-boot-prober:	partition=$(blkid | grep "$UUID" | cut
-d ':' -f 1 | tr '\n' ' ' | cut -d ' ' -f 1)
/usr/bin/os-prober:	blkid | grep btrfs | cut -d ':' -f 1
/usr/bin/os-prober:	type=$(blkid -o value -s TYPE $mapped || true)
/usr/bin/os-prober:		uuid=$(blkid -o value -s UUID $mapped)

First off you need to explain it to all authors of all random scripts
out there.

Secondly udev is not guaranteed to exist/run on every system.
