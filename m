Hey Karel,

Thanks for your patch, the changes look good to me!

I have one small follow-up question though. You added the following
sentence to the documentation for mnt_match_options():

> The alone "no" is error and all matching ends with False.

I believe this to be a good change. However, If my understanding of
this documentation comment is correct I would have expected

	mnt_match_options("bla", "no,,")

to return False as well but to my surprise it actually returns True. I
understand that this is an edge case but is that intended? Maybe the ","
should be treated as an terminating character for the "no" as well (i.e.
in addition to the null byte)?

With this patch applied it also returns False for the "no,," pattern.

Greetings,
