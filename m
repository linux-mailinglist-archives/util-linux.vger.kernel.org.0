Hello Masa,

I think I see your confusion because I was also confused by the wording
of the SMBIOS spec.  In this case, "String number" means the number of
the string appended to the Type 4 record, not a version number of the
processor.

See section 6.1.3, "Text strings", of the SMBIOS spec (version 3.4.0).

For Type 4, there can be up to 6 strings appended to the table:
   Offset 0x04: Socket Designation
   Offset 0x07: Processor Manufacturer
   Offset 0x10: Processor Version
   Offset 0x20: Serial Number
   Offset 0x21: Asset Tag
   Offset 0x22: Part Number

Each string is optional.  If the byte at one of the above offsets is 0,
that means the string is not included.  If the byte is non-0, it means
refer to the first or second or third (or so on) string appended to the
table.  It's this non-0 number that the spec calls "String number".

Example:

A Type 4 record that only defined Processor Manufacturer and Processor
Version would therefore look like:
   Offset 0x04: 0x00
   Offset 0x07: 0x01
   Offset 0x10: 0x02
   Offset 0x20: 0x00
   Offset 0x21: 0x00
   Offset 0x22: 0x00

The text of each string is free form.  Most vendors have chosen to use
Processor Manufacturer as the CPU vendor, and Processor Version as a
text description of the CPU.

Some examples from existing servers (copy/paste from the other thread):

[root@hp-m400 ~]# ./lscpu | grep -i -e vendor -e model -e stepping
Vendor ID:                       AppliedMicro
Model:                           1
Model name:                      X-Gene
Stepping:                        0x0

[root@lenovo-hr330a ~]# ./lscpu | grep -i -e vendor -e model -e stepping
Vendor ID:                       Ampere(TM)
Model:                           2
Model name:                      eMAG
Stepping:                        0x3

[root@hpe-apollo-70 ~]# ./lscpu | grep -i -e vendor -e model -e stepping
Vendor ID:                       Cavium Inc.
Model:                           1
Model name:                      Cavium ThunderX2(R) CPU CN9980 v2.1 @ 2.20GHz
Stepping:                        0x1


Therefore, I believe you are free to change the string "461F0010" to
"A64FX" in the SMBIOS Type 4 record of the FX700 and FX1000 servers'
firmware.
