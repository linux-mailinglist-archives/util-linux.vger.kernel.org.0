From:Miss: Fatima Yusuf.

For sure this mail would definitely come to you as a surprise, but do
take your good time to go through it, My name is Ms. Fatima Yusuf,i am
from Ivory Coast.

I lost my parents a year and couple of months ago. My father was a
serving director of the Agro-exporting board until his death. He was
assassinated by his business partners.Before his death, he made a
deposit of US$9.7 Million Dollars here in Cote d'ivoire which was for
the purchase of cocoa processing machine and development of another
factory before his untimely death.

Being that this part of the world experiences political and crises
time without number, there is no guarantee of lives and properties. I
cannot invest this money here any long, despite the fact it had been
my late father's industrial plans.

I want you to do me a favor to receive this funds into your country or
any safer place as the beneficiary, I have plans to invest this money
in continuation with the investment vision of my late father, but not
in this place again rather in your country. I have the vision of going
into real estate and industrial production or any profitable business
venture.

I will be ready to compensate you with 20% of the total Amount, now
all my hope is banked on you and i really wants to invest this money
in your country, where there is stability of Government, political and
economic welfare.

My greatest worry now is how to move out of this country because my
uncle is threatening to kill me as he killed my father,Please do not
let anybody hear about this, it is between me and you alone because of
my security reason.

I am waiting to hear from you.
Yours Sincerely,
Miss.Fatima Yusuf.
