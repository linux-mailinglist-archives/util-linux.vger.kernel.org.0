uuid_generate_time_generic() is not API function, so we can do there
whatever :-)

Maybe we need decomposition of complex uuid_generate_time_generic()
into small one-purpose functions and then mix these functions
in uuid_generate_time_safe() and uuid_generate_time().

What about to create small local functions with always only one
purpose and without any fallback:

 uuid_generate_time_async()         -- random bytes + gettimeofday() or -1
 uuid_generate_time_sync_by_file()  -- LIBUUID_CLOCK_FILE based or -1
 uuid_generate_time_sync_by_uuidd() -- connect() uuidd or -1

public API uuid_generate_time():

    uuid_generate_time_sync_by_uuidd() or
    uuid_generate_time_sync_by_file() or
    uuid_generate_time_async()
    
public API uuid_generate_time_safe():

    uuid_generate_time_sync_by_uuidd() (=return 0) or  
    uuid_generate_time_sync_by_file()  (=return 1) or
    -1

and uuidd will always call uuid_generate_time_sync_by_file() and
nothing else.

Yes, it's more work, but it will make code more readable, easy to
maintain and easy to extend in future.

Make sense ;-)
