Yes, it won't really simplify the code base overall because of the
need to support kernel versions that may not have the system call.

But what I didn't talk about is there's a real problem handling
large mount tables with the current method of reading the proc file
system mount tables and these tables can get very large at times.

And this is also about processes being flooded with notifications
due to heavy mount/umount activity and then re-reading the entire
mount table (or at least half on average) on every one because
there's no other way to locate the mount they are looking for.

I think the situation with util-linux isn't so bad in this respect
but I still believe keeping the in-memory mount table up to date
should see improvement. And libmount is used by quite a number of
problematic applications so improving it will translate to
improvement in those applications too.

Ultimately I'll need to look at other applications (perhaps persuade
them to use libmount).

There's also the large number of notifications itself but I'm
still not sure how to improve that. There will be a notifications
implementation to accompany the recent mount-API/fsinfo changes as
well so hopefully we'll be able to improve the situation with the
implementation of that.

The changes will be fairly difficult because the util-linux mount
handling is quite complex.

And the fact that the fsinfo() patch series hasn't been merged yet
means this isn't going to be done quickly (at least not "rushed"
anyway).

But it does need to be done ahead of the merge so we can work out what's
missing in the fsinfo() implementation and try to have things added/fixed
prior to the upstream merge.
