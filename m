TLDR: util-linux's fsck program has an interesting bug in it where if
someone runs "fsck -N", it will set up a fsck_instance context for each
filesystem with inst->pid = -1.  If someone sends the fsck process a
SIGINT/SIGTERM before it finishes enumerating filesystems, it will try
to kill all the fsck instances via "kill(inst->pid, ...);" which will
terminate every process on the system.

I was about to ask why we even care about misc/fsck.c because it's
clearly a weird old program that has been bitrotting for years and
likely replaced by some other code in util-linux.  Then I thought I had
better check util-linux, and...

https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/util-linux/util-linux.git/tree/disk-utils/fsck.c

/*
 * fsck --- A generic, parallelizing front-end for the fsck program.
 * It will automatically try to run fsck programs in parallel if the

LOL, it's the same source code, and I think it has the same bug, since
"noexecute" mode sets pid = -1 at like 688:

	/* Fork and execute the correct program. */
	if (noexecute)
		pid = -1;

and then sets inst->pid = pid at line 703:

	inst->pid = pid;

and kill_all() passes that to kill() at line 733:

	for (inst = instance_list; inst; inst = inst->next) {
		if (inst->flags & FLAG_DONE)
			continue;
		kill(inst->pid, signum);
		n++;
	}

From that I conclude that this is a real bug in util-linux, and we
ought to be talking to them about this.  Evidently this has been broken
since e2fsprogs commit 33922999 in January 1999, though it was only
added to util-linux in commit 607c2a72952f in February 2009.
