Per RFC 4222, the clock sequence *should* be incremented under various
circumstances.  Setting to to a random value (which would be required
if you are using /run/uuidd) is *allowed*, but I would argue that this
is not as good, and not as in keeping with the design spirt of UUID
version 1:


4.1.5.  Clock Sequence

   For UUID version 1, the clock sequence is used to help avoid
   duplicates that could arise when the clock is set backwards in time
   or if the node ID changes.

   If the clock is set backwards, or might have been set backwards
   (e.g., while the system was powered off), and the UUID generator can
   not be sure that no UUIDs were generated with timestamps larger than
   the value to which the clock was set, then the clock sequence has to
   be changed.  If the previous value of the clock sequence is known, it
   can just be incremented; otherwise it should be set to a random or
   high-quality pseudo-random value.


   Similarly, if the node ID changes (e.g., because a network card has
   been moved between machines), setting the clock sequence to a random
   number minimizes the probability of a duplicate due to slight
   differences in the clock settings of the machines.  If the value of
   clock sequence associated with the changed node ID were known, then
   the clock sequence could just be incremented, but that is unlikely.


If system is using a read-only root, and doesn't want to maintain a
/var partition, which some systemd installations do care about --- but
for more traditional distributions, such as RHEL and Debian, my
personal recommendation is to not try to use /run/uuidd and using
a dynamic user for uuidd.
