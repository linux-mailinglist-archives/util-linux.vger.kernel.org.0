Hello Helge ;-),

I think no maintainer wants to deal with a 1000-line mail listing 100+
minor bugs. May I suggest making the maintainer's life a little easier
by breaking things up into pieces. For example, one mail per manual
page (which would be 43 mails by my count).  But maybe Karel has
another suggestion on how you could make his life easier.

With best regards,

Michael
