I hadn't planned on producing a utility but I do have code that I've
been using to learn how to use the call.

I could turn that into a utility for use from scripts at some point.

Avoiding having to parse string output (from the proc file system
mount tables) is one of the key reasons to use a system call for
this.

So this isn't the point of doing it.

The work for this (and some other new system calls) is being done
in the kernel so the issue isn't to work out what the system call
returns as much as it is to ensure the system call provides what's
needed, implement things that aren't yet done and work out ways of
providing things that are needed but can't yet be provided.

I haven't looked at the tools at all.

It may be worth looking at them but fork and exec a program then
parse text output isn't usually the way these utilities should
work.

The focus is on eliminating the need to read the proc file system
mount tables including getting the mount information for any single
mount.

When these tables are large and there's a fair bit of mount/umount
activity this can be a significant problem.

Getting this information usually means reading on average half of
the whole mount table every time and it's not possible to get info.
on a single mount without doing this.
