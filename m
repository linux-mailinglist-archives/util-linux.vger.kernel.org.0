Historically autofs mounts were not included in mount table listings.

This is the case in other SysV autofs implementations and was also
the case with Linux autofs until we changed to use the proc file system
for the mount table.

This often leads to considerable clutter for system administrators so
it's necessary to find a way to exclude these entries from mount table
listings without causing problems for sub-systems that may need the
entries to be present.

In other Unix autofs implementations we see this is done by including
a pseudo mount option that's used as a hint by applications that want
to exclude these entries.

There's further discussion of this in the first patch.

I started trying to do this quite a while ago, glibc, automount(8) and
the kernel have been updated to use such a mount option but, for some
reason, when I canme to update util-linux I thought it would cause
problems for systemd. But when I looked at what I had done just recently
I saw that isn't the case so I'm now continuing with this change.

What I've done might not be the prefered way to do this so any comments
are welcome so it can be done the way it fits best with util-linux.
