Yes.

I can imagine this as public :-) The majority of users will use basic
simple API (just give me UUID). The advanced minority has to read docs
:-)

I can imagine use-case where you have more independent users who need
time based UUIDs, but they don't care about collisions with the other
users (for example two web applications with independent DBs, etc.)/

The default should be safe as much as possible, but we should not try
to be more smart than admins/developers as we have no clue about their
use-cases ;-)

But this is not so important for now, we can keep it as uuidd only
in UUIDD_PRIVATE namespace in libuuid/src/libuuid.sym.

If we decide to change the API (introduce a new functions) then I'd like to 
see something based on handler/context. IMHO only context/handler based libraries
are extendible and easy to maintain and ready for relatively complex tasks.

    libuuid_context *cxt = uuid_new_context();

    uuid_context_set_clockfile(cxt, "/somewhere/clock.txt");

    uuid_context_generate_time(cxt, &uuid, &state);

where @state is UUID_STATE_{SAFE,UNSAFE,UUIDD,...}

we can also add

    uuid_context_force_state(cxt, UUID_STATE_ABSOLUTE);

to make sure uuid_context_generate_time() returns only requested
quality or error, etc.

We can also for uuidd make locking optional:

    uuid_context_disable_lock(cxt, TRUE);

etc.

We can also use the context for communication with uuidd

    uuid_uuidd *uuidd = uuid_new_uuidd();

    uuid_uuidd_get_state()
    uuid_uuidd_get_pid()
    uuid_uuidd_get_statistic()
    uuid_uuidd_get_clockfile()
    uuid_uuidd_get_error()

    uuid_uuidd_get_uuid()
    ....


Anyway, the first step we need uuid_generate_* functions
refactoring to clean up the spaghetti stuff.
