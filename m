I do not understand why this is a problem. The topology (number of
threads, cores, etc.) is specific to the type of CPU, right?

I guess the sibling maps in kernel describes this.

This design has been motivated by heterogenous systems :-)

  Model name:           Cortex-A53
    Model:              4
    Thread(s) per core: 1
    Core(s) per socket: 4
    Socket(s):          1
  Model name:           Cortex-A72
    Model:              2
    Thread(s) per core: 1
    Core(s) per socket: 2
    Socket(s):          1

How we can display "Core(s) per socket" if we will not differentiate
between the types?

Then we need to fix _this output_, but not ignore cputypes for whole
lscpu.

I don't like it. We had this output before lscpu rewrite and was pretty
confusing for users.
