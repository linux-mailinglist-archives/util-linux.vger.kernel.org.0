It would be nice to start with some low-level things to read info
about a target (mountpoint) into libmnt_fs, something like:

    int mnt_fsinfo_fill_fs(chat char *tgt, struct libmnt_fs *fs)

and fill create a complete mount table by fsinfo():

    int mnt_fsinfo_fill_table(struct libmnt_table *tab)

... probably add fsinfo.c to code to keep it all together.

So, after then we can use these functions in our code. 

The nice place where is ugly overhead with the current mountinfo is
context_umount.c code, see lookup_umount_fs() and
mnt_context_find_umount_fs(). In this code we have mountpoint and we
need more information about it (due to redirection to umount.<type>
helpers, userspace mount options, etc.). It sounds like ideal to use
mnt_fsinfo_fill_fs() if possible.

The most visible change will be to use mnt_fsinfo_fill_table() with in
mnt_table_parse_file() if the file name is "/proc/self/mountinfo".
This will be huge improvement as we use this function in systemd on
each mount table change...

The question is how easily will be to replace mountinfo with fsinfo().

Note that we have also #util-linux on freenode IRC.
