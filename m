Consulting and project financing. 

Hello, I'm Nasser Rashid, a business financial specialist and 
investment consultant experienced in financial funding services. 
We are headed by a group of high profile investors from the Gulf 
who are interested and willing to fund any current projects you 
are undergoing as they are privately seeking means of expanding 
their investment portfolio internationally. Should you be 
interested in engaging us for a more detailed discussion on the 
proposal, we would be happy to do so in whatever medium you find 
more appropriate for this engagement.

Thank you and stay safe,
 
Nasser Rashid, CFA,
