Package: util-linux (Debian testing)
Version: 2.40.2-9
Severity: minor

   * What led up to the situation?

     Checking for defects with

test-[g|n]roff -mandoc -t -K utf8 -rF0 -rHY=0 -ww -b -z < "man page"

  [Use "groff -e ' $' <file>" to find trailing spaces.]

  ["test-groff" is a script in the repository for "groff"; is not shipped]
(local copy and "troff" slightly changed by me).

  [The fate of "test-nroff" was decided in groff bug #55941.]

   * What was the outcome of this action?


troff: backtrace: file '<stdin>':276
troff:<stdin>:276: warning: [page 4, 3.6i]: cannot break line


   * What outcome did you expect instead?

     No output (no warnings).

-.-

  General remarks and further material, if a diff-file exist, are in the
attachments.

  Any program (person), that produces man pages, should check the output
for defects by using (both groff and nroff)

[gn]roff -mandoc -t -ww -b -z -K utf8  <man page>

  The same goes for man pages that are used as an input.

  For a style guide use

  mandoc -T lint

-.-

  So any 'generator' should check its products with the above mentioned
'groff', 'mandoc',  and additionally with 'nroff ...'.

  This is just a simple quality control measure.

  The 'generator' may have to be corrected to get a better man page,
the source file may, and any additional file may.

  Common defects:

  Input text line longer than 80 bytes.

  Not removing trailing spaces (in in- and output).
  The reason for these trailing spaces should be found and eliminated.

  Not beginning each input sentence on a new line.
Lines should thus be shorter.

  See man-pages(7), item 'semantic newline'.

-.-

The difference between the formatted output of the original and patched file
can be seen with:

  nroff -mandoc <file1> > <out1>
  nroff -mandoc <file2> > <out2>
  diff -u <out1> <out2>

and for groff, using

"printf '%s\n%s\n' '.kern 0' '.ss 12 0' | groff -mandoc -Z - "

instead of 'nroff -mandoc'

  Add the option '-t', if the file contains a table.

  Read the output of 'diff -u' with 'less -R' or similar.

-.-.

  If 'man' (man-db) is used to check the manual for warnings,
the following must be set:

  The option "-warnings=w"

  The environmental variable:

export MAN_KEEP_STDERR=yes (or any non-empty value)

  or

  (produce only warnings):

export MANROFFOPT="-ww -b -z"

export MAN_KEEP_STDERR=yes (or any non-empty value)

-.-.

Wrong distance between sentences in the input file.

  Separate the sentences and subordinate clauses; each begins on a new
line.  See man-pages(7) ("Conventions for source file layout") and
"info groff" ("Input Conventions").

  The best procedure is to always start a new sentence on a new line,
at least, if you are typing on a computer.

Remember coding: Only one command ("sentence") on each (logical) line.

E-mail: Easier to quote exactly the relevant lines.

Generally: Easier to edit the sentence.

Patches: Less unaffected text.

Search for two adjacent words is easier, when they belong to the same line,
and the same phrase.

  The amount of space between sentences in the output can then be
controlled with the ".ss" request.


37:\fBlsblk\fP lists information about all available or the specified block devices. The \fBlsblk\fP command reads the \fBsysfs\fP filesystem and \fBudev db\fP to gather information. If the udev db is not available or \fBlsblk\fP is compiled without udev support, then it tries to read LABELs, UUIDs and filesystem types from the block device. In this case root permissions are necessary.
39:By default, the command prints all block devices (except RAM disks) in a tree\-like format. The same device can be repeated in the tree if it relates to other devices. The \fB\-\-merge\fP option is recommended for more complicated setups to gather groups of devices and describe complex N:M relationships.
41:The tree\-like output (or \fBchildren[]\fP array in the JSON output) is enabled only if NAME column it present in the output or when \fB\-\-tree\fP command line option is used. See also \fB\-\-nodeps\fP and \fB\-\-list\fP to control the tree formatting.
43:The default output, as well as the default output from options like \fB\-\-fs\fP and \fB\-\-topology\fP, is subject to change. So whenever possible, you should avoid using default outputs in your scripts. Always explicitly define expected columns by using \fB\-\-output\fP \fIcolumns\-list\fP and \fB\-\-list\fP in environments where a stable output is required.
47:Note that \fBlsblk\fP might be executed in time when \fBudev\fP does not have all information about recently added or modified devices yet. In this case it is recommended to use \fBudevadm settle\fP before \fBlsblk\fP to synchronize with udev.
49:The relationship between block devices and filesystems is not always one\-to\-one. The filesystem may use more block devices, or the same filesystem may be accessible by more paths. This is the reason why \fBlsblk\fP provides MOUNTPOINT and MOUNTPOINTS (pl.) columns. The column MOUNTPOINT displays only one mount point (usually the last mounted instance of the filesystem), and the column MOUNTPOINTS displays by multi\-line cell all mount points associated with the device.
67:power of 2^10 (1024). Abbreviations of symbols are exhibited truncated in order
85:Do not print holder devices or slaves. For example, \fBlsblk \-\-nodeps /dev/sda\fP prints information about the sda device only.
90:Use \fIcolumn\fP as a de\-duplication key to de\-duplicate output tree. If the key is not available for the device, or the device is a partition and parental whole\-disk device provides the same key than the device is always printed.
97:Exclude the devices specified by the comma\-separated \fIlist\fP of major device numbers. Note that RAM disks (major=1) are excluded by default if \fB\-\-all\fP is not specified. The filter is applied to the top\-level devices only. This may be confusing for \fB\-\-list\fP output format where hierarchy of the devices is not obvious.
102:Output info about filesystems. This option is equivalent to \fB\-o NAME,FSTYPE,FSVER,LABEL,UUID,FSAVAIL,FSUSE%,MOUNTPOINTS\fP. The authoritative information about filesystems and raids is provided by the \fBblkid\fP(8) command.
107:Include devices specified by the comma\-separated \fIlist\fP of major device numbers. The filter is applied to the top\-level devices only. This may be confusing for \fB\-\-list\fP output format where hierarchy of the devices is not obvious.
117:Use JSON output format. It\(cqs strongly recommended to use \fB\-\-output\fP and also \fB\-\-tree\fP if necessary. Note that \fBchildren[]\fP is used only if NAME column or \fB\-\-tree\fP is used.
122:Produce output in the form of a list. The output does not provide information about relationships between devices and since version 2.34 every device is printed only once if \fB\-\-pairs\fP or \fB\-\-raw\fP not specified (the parsable outputs are maintained in backwardly compatible way).
127:Group parents of sub\-trees to provide more readable output for RAIDs and Multi\-path devices. The tree\-like output is required.
132:Output info about device owner, group and mode. This option is equivalent to \fB\-o NAME,SIZE,OWNER,GROUP,MODE\fP.
152:Specify which output columns to print. Use \fB\-\-list\-columns\fP to get a list of all supported columns. The columns may affect tree\-like output. The default is to use tree for the column \*(AqNAME\*(Aq (see also \fB\-\-tree\fP).
164:Produce output in the form of key="value" pairs. The output lines are still ordered by dependencies. All potentially unsafe value characters are hex\-escaped (\(rsx<code>). See also option \fB\-\-shell\fP.
174:Print only the devices that meet the conditions specified by the expr. The
175:filter is assessed prior to lsblk collecting data for all output columns. Only
177:the system. This approach can enhance performance when compared to
180:This feature is EXPERIMENTAL. See also \fBscols\-filter\fP(5). For example
201:This feature is EXPERIMENTAL. See also \fBscols\-filter\fP(5).
206:Define a custom counter. The counters are printed after the standard output.
209:the aggregation function, supported functions are: count, min, max, or sum. The
212:If the \fIparam\fP is not specified, then the counter counts the number of lines. This
213:feature is EXPERIMENTAL. See also \fB\-\-ct\-filter\fP.
234:Define a restriction for the next counter. This feature is EXPERIMENTAL. See also \fB\-\-ct\fP
235:and \fBscols\-filter\fP(5). For example, aggregate sizes by device type:
254:Produce output in raw format. The output lines are still ordered by dependencies. All potentially unsafe characters are hex\-escaped (\(rsx<code>) in the NAME, KNAME, LABEL, PARTLABEL and MOUNTPOINT columns.
259:Output info about SCSI devices only. All partitions, slaves and holder devices are ignored.
264:Print dependencies in inverse order. If the \fB\-\-list\fP output is requested then the lines are still ordered by dependencies.
269:Force tree\-like output format. If \fIcolumn\fP is specified, then a tree is printed in the column. The default is NAME column.
274:Output info about block\-device topology. This option is equivalent to
291:Specifies output width as a number of characters. The default is the number of the terminal columns, and if not executed on a terminal, then output width is not restricted at all by default. This option also forces \fBlsblk\fP to assume that terminal control characters and unsafe characters are not allowed. The expected use\-case is for example when \fBlsblk\fP is used by the \fBwatch\fP(1) command.
296:Sort output lines by \fIcolumn\fP. This option enables \fB\-\-list\fP output format by default. It is possible to use the option \fB\-\-tree\fP to force tree\-like output and than the tree branches are sorted by the \fIcolumn\fP.
301:The column name will be modified to contain only characters allowed for shell variable identifiers, for example, MIN_IO and FSUSE_PCT instead of MIN\-IO and FSUSE%. This is usable, for example, with \fB\-\-pairs\fP. Note that this feature has been automatically enabled for \fB\-\-pairs\fP in version 2.37, but due to compatibility issues, now it\(cqs necessary to request this behavior by \fB\-\-shell\fP.
311:Gather data for a Linux instance other than the instance from which the \fBlsblk\fP command is issued. The specified directory is the system root of the Linux instance to be inspected. The real device nodes in the target directory can be replaced by text files with udev attributes.
364:The \fBlsblk\fP command needs to be able to look up each block device by major:minor numbers, which is done by using \fI/sys/dev/block\fP. This sysfs block directory appeared in kernel 2.6.27 (October 2008). In case of problems with a new enough kernel, check that \fBCONFIG_SYSFS\fP was enabled at the time of the kernel build.
