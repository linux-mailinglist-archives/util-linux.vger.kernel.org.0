Yes, re-open() sounds like a possible way.

The dup() is not necessary. The library already support private FD for
probing. See blkid_new_probe_from_filename() and BLKID_FL_PRIVATE_FD.

It's also often used when the library probe whole-disk device (when you
probe sda1 than it also reads data from partition table on sda). In
this case it opens a separate FD.

It's for floppies (0.001% of all cases). IMHO re-open is good enough and
better than force changes in all applications :-)

I'll try to prepare a patch and ask you for test/review. Thanks!

 Karel
