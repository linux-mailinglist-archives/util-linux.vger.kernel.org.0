I'm not sure about the comparison in overhead of this either.

But it's something that needs to be done to get familiar with how
to use fsinfo() and to work out what else needs to be done.

As you know this has already shown that getting file system specific
options isn't working yet for most file systems and I'll need to
implement the missing ->fsinfo() super block operation for (at least
some, probably many) file systems just to continue the work.

There is a slightly less obvious difference using fsinfo() over
the proc file system to get the whole mount table.

When you open a proc file system mount table the kernel takes locks
that will prevent (at least) mount, umount and remount actions until
the proc file is closed.

With fsinfo() the locks need to be taken but at a much finer
granularity so mount actions can continue in parallel.

There's a price for that locking improvement though, if your trying
to get a whole consistent mount table you need to check it hasn't
changed while you read it and if it has you need to start over.

So getting the whole table with fsinfo() will definitely need to be
evaluated against using the proc file system.

But there's quite a lot of processing that happens when the kernel
issues proc mount records, the path calculations are quite expensive
for example, so the difference isn't clear cut.

I think we will be able to but probably not for a while, there's
quite a bit still to do for fsinfo() by the look of it.

Excessive resource usage of systemd is one of the main motivations
for me doing this so improving that is at the top of the priority
list for me.

I do.

This string isn't always a string value that comes from the mount
kernel structure, the the proc file system needs to call upon the
file system to get it in some cases.

For example when you see an NFS <server>:<path> in the proc file system
output.

To get this string the proc file system checks if the file system provides
a super block operation ->show_devname() and calls it to get the name
otherwise it copies the string from the mount structure.

As David says, to deal with this it isn't as simple as adding an fsinfo()
request because there are cases where it can have multiple values.

A similar thing is done for field 4 where, if the file system defines
a super block operation ->show_path() it will be called to get the
path, otherwise it's calculated using mount's root. Interestingly NFS
appears to always return "/" for this from its ->show_path() function.

And, as I mentioned above, there's the needed ->fsinfo() super operation
to cover the use of the existing ->show_options() operation (provided
by pretty much all file systems) to get the file system specific options.

So there's quite a bit of detail to be worked out for fsinfo() to be
able to correctly provide all mount information.

But, hey, that was the point of doing this now.

Ian
