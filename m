Hi

Sorry to say this, but the fact the 'someone' has created 'GUID' for GPT with 
the name 'BIOS boot' doesn't really make anything in the Linux world - so far 
I was not even aware such partition type exists (not using this myself).

It's never even been submitted to lvm2 as something to be understood by tool 
till this thread.

There are over 220 types shown by 'cfdisk' just for GPT and there is a 
completely different set for DOS partition types...

So how should we know which type is lvm2 allowed to 'use' freely ?

Should we now store somewhere those 'hundreds' GUID where there is something 
with Linux in its name ?

I don't think this is a practical thing to do in lvm2 nor in many other 
userland tools that are doing something with block devices.

There should likely be something in blkid telling other Linux tools  'don't 
touch this device unless you are XYZ' eventually you use some --force override 
option.

Well protection needs to be from all sides here - otherwise it makes no sense. 
  When the grub sees some signature, it must be telling to a user and not just 
let user to loose his data blindly.

And in the same way blkid should expose installed grub loader - currently the 
partition with installed grub looks 'empty' with blkid....
