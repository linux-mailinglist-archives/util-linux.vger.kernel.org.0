 Hi Mikko,

Good point. I have tried to optimize the content comparison (using the
kernel crypto API), but the binary tree is still the original
implementation and there is probably room for further optimization.

Perhaps storing all 'struct stat' information for every file is
excessive, as there is information that we do not need (such as atime,
ctime, st_blksize, st_blocks). Some information is only necessary if
respect_{mode,owner,time,xattrs} are enabled.

The tree also contains paths for all the files. If you have many
subdirectories or long directory names, there is a lot of duplicate
data in the binary tree. One possible solution could be to keep
directory paths in a separate hash table and only store pointers to
the names table in the metadata tree.

Another problem I see is that the hardlink keeps the entire
binary tree in memory during the second stage when it compares file
contents in the visitor() function. However, at this point, we do not
need the tree entries that are already unique and will never be used
to compare file contents.

This is not a trivial task. It would be better to begin with
optimizing memory usage before implementing more invasive changes. 

I am unsure how you plan to compare all files if the metadata is
stored in multiple independent trees.

Good point, send patch :-)

Yes, GitHub is the best repository. You can also use it for pull
requests and reviews.

My suggestion is to add debug messages to see where the problem is,
calculate the size of metadata, the size of paths, and the size of
calculated data checksums. Please share the results.
