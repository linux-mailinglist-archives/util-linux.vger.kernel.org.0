Yes, we need to support both versions. 

The new version of the API will significantly improve performance in
situation when you need more information about a mountpoint (for
example fstype, device name, mount options, etc.) -- nice example is
umount or remount.

Now we parse all /proc/self/mountinfo to get one line from the file.
This is problem on systems with huge number of the mountpoints and on
systems where kernel mount table is modified very often and userspace
need to be synchronized with the table (e.g. systemd dependencies,
etc).

All this is about a new syscall fsinfo(). The new mount API (mount(2)
replacement) is another story :-)

For end users all the changes should be invisible. The same libmount
binary should be usable everywhere independently on the new syscalls.

It's possible that we will extend the library API to make it easy for
applications to get info about a mountpoint without mountinfo file
parsing, but it should be also possible to do it with mountinfo as
fallback if there is no fsinfo().
