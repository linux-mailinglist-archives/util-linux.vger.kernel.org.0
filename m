I can imagine this as optional solution (command line option), but I
have doubts to use O_NONBLOCK by default for all block devices. I have
no example, but it sounds like a way how to introduce regressions in
libblkid behavior. (Any kernel guy around?) Is it really only cdrom
driver(s) where O_NONBLOCK has any impact? What about USB, some random
SCSI, ... I don't know.

The another problem is that the library does not have to open the device,
you can use already open file descriptor (blkid_probe_set_device()).=20
So, in many cases the patch will have no effect.

It's better to use lsblk in script, it reads info from udev -- call
blindly blkid(8) is usually overkill.
