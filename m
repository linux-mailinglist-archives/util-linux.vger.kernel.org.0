Subject: [PATCH] man pages: Add a comma after "e.g." and "i.e."
Message-ID: <20191214224247.GA15526@rhi.hi.is>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Disposition: inline
User-Agent: Mutt/1.5.20 (2009-12-10)
Sender: util-linux-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <util-linux.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: util-linux@vger.kernel.org

  Add a comma (,) after "e.g." and "i.e.", or use English words
(man-pages(7) [package "manpages"]).

  Abbreviation points should be protected (usually with the
non-printing, zero width character '\&') from being interpreted as an
end of sentence, if they are not, and that independent of their current
place on the line.

  This is important when typing, as one does not usually know in
advance when the editor jumps to a new line.
