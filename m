Hi Paul

The last(1) is pretty simple tool.  It can and will display information
tracked in utmp(5) data.

http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/utmp.5.html

The utmp data is stored over many many reboots, that might stay around for
years.  Notice that changing utmp(5) is probably not the easiest thing to
achieve.  That format is part of POSIX.  Assuming standards are changed then
update to various libc implementations is needed as well.

Alternatively some sort of extented-utmp format could be created to avoid
standardization work, but getting that to adopted might be hard.  While utmp
has it's flaws it is not exactly broken.  In short while I'm not strictly
against better reboot reason tracking I am a somewhat doubtful how feasible
this work is.

That said what is that memtool?  I have never noticed it before.  By glance
it looks a little like abandonware.  Maybe it could be get a home in
util-linux if a tool like that is found to be useful, and old maintainer
does not mind.
