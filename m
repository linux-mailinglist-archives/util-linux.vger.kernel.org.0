Now when I think about it I'm not sure if create complete mount table
by fsinfo() is the right way. Maybe many fsinfo() calls will be more
slow than generate mountinfo file in kernel and read() in userspace.
Not sure.

Yes, it would be really nice if we can get all info from fsinfo(). It
opens a new possibilities for us to make things like umount, remount,
and systemd more effective.

Do you mean "source" field (9th column in mountinfo)? The device is
defined by maj:min (3rd column) in the file (well, whatever the devno
means for things like btrfs;-).

The "source" should be unmodified string as specified in userspace for
mount(2) syscall, otherwise things like "mount -a" can not compare the
kernel mount table with fstab.
