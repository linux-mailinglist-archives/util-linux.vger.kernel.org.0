Subject: [PATCH] Manual pages: runuser.1, su.1: miscellaneous wording and formatting fixes
Date:   Tue, 14 Jul 2020 14:20:00 +0200
Message-Id: <20200714122000.51849-1-mtk.manpages@gmail.com>
X-Mailer: git-send-email 2.26.2
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
Sender: util-linux-owner@vger.kernel.org
Precedence: bulk
List-ID: <util-linux.vger.kernel.org>
X-Mailing-List: util-linux@vger.kernel.org

Various wording and formatting fixes. Nothing too contentnious, I think,
so I rolled these changes into one patch.

Since there is much common text in su.1 and runuser.1, I've combined
the changes to both pages into one patch, and, as far as possible,
ensured that changes to the common pieces of text match across the
two pages.
