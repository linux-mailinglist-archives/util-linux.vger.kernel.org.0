Patch sent which fixes the problem for me. Related to this, I have found out
that loop device reuse detection code sometimes fails with EPERM (if I run
the mount loop long enough). I have tracked this down to e.g.
loopcxt_get_sizelimit() calling ul_path_read_u64() which fails (loop device
just got torn down) and ul_path_read_u64() always returns -1 on error which
gets somewhat confusingly translated to EPERM error. I think this should be
handled more gracefully so I'll send patches to fix this as well.
