So you want to use the original C libraries and wrap them from rust,
correct? Not reimplement them.

These libraries are LGPL. Your crates, for which are asking about
internal details are licensed as Apache or MIT, which looks iffy.
Especially if the libraries are then linked statically.
Best stick to the LGPL.

These are a lot of questions. I'll respond to the ones I have

responses.

This should only be true for closures. If you use a regular function with
static lifetime fdisk_table_sort_partitions() should work fine.
A closure does not make sense here anyways.

The mnt_table is owned by your rust code. So the rust code can clean up
the userdata together with the mnt_table.

Here the data should be owned by the function calling
mnt_table_find_next_fs() and it will be cleaned up nicely when the
function returns.

Why use v2.39 and not the latest versions?
Some of your problems may already be resolved there.

This question does not make sense. It's not the responsibility of your
code to look at the raw image file.
util-linux is fuzzed with random input as part of oss-fuzz.

blkid.tab is an internal file. Why do you need to reproduce it?

Seems quite obvious to me. It allows you to search for files with a
certain tag value.

<snip the code>

Why is all this pointless code in the email?
If somebody is not capable of looking up the code they won't be able to
help anyways.

`struct blkid_struct_probe` is internal. The types it uses are of no
concern to your code. Stick to the public interface.

If the function is documented as being able to return an error, then
write your code with this consideration.

The docstring defines the interface, trust it.

blkid --list-filesystems

This is documented.

This is documented in libblkid(3).
I wouldn't represent this as enum, though.

Why is for example `mnt_fs_print_debug` missing?
This looks random.
Don't try to "improve" the API. It will break at some point.

Why? It is a private implementation detail.

It modifies the entry in memory.

Looks to me like it extends the context with information found in
