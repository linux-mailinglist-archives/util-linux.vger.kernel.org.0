 == DESCRIPTION
 
-*hardlink* is a tool which replaces copies of a file with hardlinks or copy-on-write clones, therefore saving space.
-
-*hardlink* creates a binary tree from file sizes and after that, it compares files with the same sizes. There are two basic content comparison methods. *memcmp* method directly reads data blocks from files and compares them. The other method is based on checksums (like SHA256), in this case for each data block is calculated checksum by Linux kernel crypto API, and this checksum is stored in userspace and used for files comparison. For each file is also cached "intro" buffer (32 bytes), this buffer is used independently on the comparison method and requested cache-size and io-size. The "intro" buffer dramatically reduces operations with data content as files are very often different from the beginning.
