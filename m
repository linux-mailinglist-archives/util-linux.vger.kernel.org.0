It means that your application reads more than 1000 UUIDs per second
in one thread :-) The "cache" has 1 second live-time.

hmm ...

Well, uu.time_low is uint32_t, so there should be enough bytes to
handle 1000000 UUIDs by the cache (and it also increments uu.time_mid
and uu.time_hi_and_version).

If I read the code correctly than in theory the cache size could
be UINT32_MAX.

The question is, what is the bottleneck? From my point            

    rewind/flock/fscanf/rewind/fprintf/fflush/unlock             
                                    
seems like a pretty expensive solution for the sequence file. Maybe for
the next development we should think about something more elegant like
a memory shared between uuidd instances. The question is also if uuidd 
has to share the file with the library because for extreme use-case like
databases, it does not make sense.

 Applied, thanks!
