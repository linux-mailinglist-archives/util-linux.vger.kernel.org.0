Hi Karel,

Thanks for giving me some suggestions on where to focus
my efforts.

Ok, thanks for this,

That sounds like an ideal opportunity for improvement by using
fsinfo(). I'll look there too.

I've been looking at libmount but I'm not sure I was focusing on
libmnt_fs so I'm not sure yet.

A large part of doing this early is to find out what's missing
and see if it's possible to update fsinfo().

For example, the devanme in mountinfo which can be different to
the devname returned by fsinfo(), David has said it's not straight
forward to change but at least he's aware of it and thinking about
it.

Thanks
Ian
