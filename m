I was not thinking triggering such discussion about cal.

I don't know if my argument is a good one, reading the code I have found that
 for some locale the room available is not enough to put the month and
the year on a single line.

If someone can give me example of one or two locales with this issue
to do some test, I will appreciate it.

So I think for such locale it is better to have the year only at the top.

And this behavior is closed to the physical calendar and classic year
calendar as you can see on google image "year calendar" search.

So I think we can keep it as it and add an option to change the
behavior (--noyear-header as Karel has proposed)

What do you think about adding options -A and -B as in ncal ?
[-A months] [-B months]
