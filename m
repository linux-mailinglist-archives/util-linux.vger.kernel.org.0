OUR GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY

Hello Dear Friend,

Complement of the day, i hope you are doing great today. However, I am
Mrs.Susan Jones, an auditor with one of the new generation banks here
in Burkina Faso.

I am writing you this letter based on the latest development at my
Department. i discovered some abandoned huge amount of money, Ten
Million, Five hundred thousand  United States Dollars.($10.500.000).
Now I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot
be approved to a local bank account here, but can only be approved to
any foreign account and foreign beneficiary because the money is in US
dollars

This will be  a legitimate transaction once you accept to build trust
with me and follow simple instruction doing the transfer process,
until the total sum transfer out of the bank here to your own bank
account any where in the world, and I agreed to share the total money
50/50 with you once you successful confirmed it in your bank account.
But any expenses doing the transfer process will be deduct from the
amount before sharing, If you are interested to work with me and
provide a good receiving bank account, get back to me as soon as
possible with the following details below.

Your full name
Your Profession
Your direct mobile phone number
Your Scanned International passport or any of your identity

NOTE: PLEASE IT YOU ARE NOT INTERESTED DON'T BORDER TO RESPOND BACK TO
AVOID TIME WASTED.

As soon as I receive these data's, I will forward to you the
application form which you will send to the bank for the claim and
transfer of the fund into your bank account as the  new beneficial.

I am waiting to hear from you soon

Yours
Mrs.Susan Jones
