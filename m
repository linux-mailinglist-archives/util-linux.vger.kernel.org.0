Note that libuuid in util-linux is actively maintained and improved.

It already supports MD5 and SHA1 based UUIDs, and I think we can add
the new versions v6 (Reordered Gregorian time-based), v7 (Unix Epoch
time-based) and v8 (custom SHA256/SHA512 based) in the near feature.

CC also to Michael, who worked on libuuid in last years; not sure
but maybe v6, which improves use in databases, could be attractive for
SAP, see:
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-uuidrev-rfc4122bis/
