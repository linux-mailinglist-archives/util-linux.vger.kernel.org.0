Note that Bernhard Voelker sent me (off list, but thanks;-) another to
link the original coreutils discussion:

 https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2019-05/msg00156.html

where is something about close() and dup(). My note:

It seems there is no ideal solution which is portable and reliable
on all platforms (kernels).  

The current solution with std{out,err} close is also not elegant as the 
close makes it useless with things like ASAN or another built-in debuggers,
and it's incompatible with some libc.

The question is what does it mean for util-linux. I don't think we
need 100% reliability on all platforms; the primary target is Linux,
commonly used filesystems, standard use-cases and code (=!behavior)
portability -- everything else is bonus. From this point of view
dup()+close() sounds like better than the current solution.

From my point of view all this game with the streams is just a way how
to detect some basic users' mistakes. I don't think we can detect
serious I/O errors without fsync(), and close() itself does not
guarantee anything. So, it does not make sense trying to make it
super durable, reliable and portable to all operation systems if at
the end you rely on poor close() ...
