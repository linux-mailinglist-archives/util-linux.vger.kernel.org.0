For libmount/mount(8)/swapon, everything after 3rd field is optional.

swapon(1) supports pri= or discard= options, so the field makes sense

The "default" should be described better on the man page. I'll fix it.
Its _kernel_ default for the filesystem, mount, or swapon has no
built-in default.

Frankly, "default" would be the best do describe what happen for a
swap area or an FS.

The default is rw, the man page is wrong here.

It depends who read the man page, I can imagine that some parsers
requires it.

I have committed:
https://github.com/util-linux/util-linux/commit/43a6b183d8945cc91307f21adc8070254eb925b5

I'm unsure if this is explicit enough, but it answers the basics (I hope).

Good point.
