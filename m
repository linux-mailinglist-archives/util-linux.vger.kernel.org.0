My motivation for writing the SMBIOS patch was the exact opposite
problem: the original AppliedMicro X-Gene and newer Ampere eMAG are both
identified as X-Gene by lscpu when using the hard-coded tables.
(AppliedMicro was acquired by Macom, then the server CPU team split out
into a new company named Ampere and the X-Gene 3 was rebranded as eMAG.)
The X-Gene output on an eMAG system is often confusing to people
(including myself).

The "CPU implementer" and "CPU part" values are the same for X-Gene and
eMAG.  The difference is in the "CPU variant" field, but lscpu does not
use the variant number in its tables.

## X-Gene
~]# grep -m5 CPU /proc/cpuinfo
CPU implementer : 0x50
CPU architecture: 8
CPU variant     : 0x0
CPU part        : 0x000
CPU revision    : 1

## eMAG
~]# grep -m5 CPU /proc/cpuinfo
CPU implementer : 0x50
CPU architecture: 8
CPU variant     : 0x3
CPU part        : 0x000
CPU revision    : 2


I thought about trying to extend lscpu to add the variant value to the
tables, but then I realized the strings already exist in SMBIOS Type 4.
Furthermore, using SMBIOS Type 4 reduces the maintenance costs for lscpu
since it no longer needs the hard-coded tables (at least for servers).
