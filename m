In the end, VERSIONS and ATTRIBUTES turned out to be irrelevant
(I have those sections in man-pages), and I moved HISTORY down
below notes, to produce the following order:

NAME
SYNOPSIS
CONFIGURATION
DESCRIPTION
OPTIONS
EXIT STATUS
RETURN VALUE
ERRORS
ENVIRONMENT
FILES
CONFORMING TO
NOTES
HISTORY
BUGS
EXAMPLE
AUTHORS
COPYRIGHT
SEE ALSO
AVAILABILITY

The above matches man-pages(7), but with some additions
(HISTORY, AVAILABILITY). The difference here is small enough
that maybe you could just add a note somewhere in the project
deferring to man-pages(7) for guidance?

Across the 120+ pages there remain somewhat more than 80
oddball section names. Perhaps some of that can be tidied up
with manual edits (e.g., using .SS instead of .SH). I may take
a look at a few of those pages.

I [mis]said "one or [two] sections at a time". I've done the fixes 
rather around three section headers at a time, and in the end it was
three (large) patches, coming your way.

Finally, earlier, to address an inconsistency in the use of
EXAMPLE vs EXAMPLES in different pages, I switched everything 
to EXAMPLE (which is what I currently use in man-pages).
However, I did some investigation of a large corpus of manual
pages, and I see that EXAMPLES is rather more common than EXAMPLE,
and I also happened to see that EXAMPLES is what is in the POSIX
manual pages. So, I'm considering to switch that change in the
opposite direction util-linux, and I will also make the change in
man-pages.

Thanks,

Michael
