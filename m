 Hi,

I have fixed the --help and removed "increment".

well, this is --help stupidity, man page is better. Fixed.

hmm... but it will introduce regression as -n is interpreted as
absolute number now, no increment. And at first glance at Google you
can see that -n is in almost all how-to articles ;-(

I think we need to keep -n in the game for BSD-style too.

What about:

  renice [-n] [+-]<prio> [[-p/--pid] pid ...] [[-g/--pgrp] pgid ...] [[-u/-=
-user] user ...]

and keep <prio> is absolute number if without +/-; and as relative
if prefixed with + or - ?

It means people who use=20

  renice -n 10 [-p ... -g ... -u ... ]

will not see any regression, and people who use

  renice -n +2 [-p ... -g ... -u ... ]

will see that it work as expected :-)


For POSIX-like getopt_long() way, how does it support more arguments?
For example in BSD way you can use:

    renice 10 -p 1 -p 2 -p 3

to apply 10 for processes 1, 2 and 3. How you can write it in POSIX way?
