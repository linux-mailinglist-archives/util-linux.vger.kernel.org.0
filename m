Do we really need it? :-) I mean that

     --time-format ctime

makes connection between the log messages and real clocks. Is it enough?

I think negative numbers makes sense for this use-case. For example
"--time-format reltime" uses positive number relative to system start,
you want something like "reverse-reltime". Something like:

    [    -6.634976] IPv6: ADDRCONF(NETDEV_CHANGE): eno1: link becomes ready

I have nothing against this feature. So, go ahead if you want.
