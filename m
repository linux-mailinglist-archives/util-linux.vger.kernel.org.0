The question is if close() for stdout and stderr is the right way to
go. 

In an ideal world it would be enough to use ferror()+fflush(),
unfortunately for example NFS has never reached an ideal world and it
requires fclose()... See

 https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gnulib/2019-04/msg00061.html

Florian (added to CC), also suggested to use dup3() for the
descriptors and then fclose() for the new handle. It sounds like a
pretty elegant solution how to avoid all the issues with NULL and it's
also robust enough if you accidentally call close_stream() more than
once.

See

 https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1732450#c4

Maybe we can improve include/closestream.h to use dup3(), than it would
be possible keep all in the header file as inline functions. 

Comments?

I don't think we need to check if we already performed this operation
as it's always called only once by atexit() and with dup3() it will be
robust enough.
