man hwclock: "This option is capable of understanding many time and
date formats." :-) 

It was for decade exec(date), so it supports almost whatever and it's 
reason why we have ported the code from gnulib to uti-linux. 

The question is if we really need to support it. Maybe it's time to
make it more restricted and rely only on simple format like
'2525-08-14 07:11:05'.
