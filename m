It's been awhile since I've looked at the powerpc-utils drmgr command and
pseries DLPAR code but a quick scan makes and it appears that it hasn't changed
too much. Given that, some thoughts.

The sysfs 'removable' file was a great help when memory DLPAR was driven
from userspace in the powerpc-utils drmgr command. Having this check did improve
performance though I can't point to any numbers.

Currently, memory DLPAR is done completely in the kernel. The request is
initiated from drmgr writing to /sys/kernel/dlpar (for pHyp partitions)
or from a hotplug interrupt (for guests). I don't believe the 'removable'
sysfs file is used in either of these paths by drmgr. The only time it is
used is on older kernels that do not support in-kernel memory DLPAR.

Given this, I don't think removing the 'removable' sysfs file would cause any
issues for the drmgr command. The only scenario I can think of is using an old
version of drmgr that does not support in-kernel memory DLPAR on a new kernel
where the 'removable' sysfs file has been removed. This doesn't seem likely
though and drmgr could be updated to detect this.
