Umpf. udev has a clearly defined protocol to comprehensively avoid
such issues:

https://systemd.io/BLOCK_DEVICE_LOCKING

Partitioning tools should simply follow this logic, and udev and
programs downstream from it will not even be tempted to operate with
half-written superblocks, partition tables or such.

Hence, I personally am not convinced of that O_DIRECT approach. First
of all, it only works on superblocks that have a useful checksum
covering enough relevant data, and it can never really catch scenarios
where a disk is comprehensively repartitioned, i.e. one or more fs and
partition metadata changed at the same time...
