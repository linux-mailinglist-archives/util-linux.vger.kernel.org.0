Yes, I was one of the people who asked that the DMI and the lookup table 
be displayed as different fields and so far it looks like its working 
well. Thanks!

Right, another example :


Vendor ID:              ARM
   BIOS Vendor ID:       Broadcom
   Model name:           Cortex-A72
     BIOS Model name:    BCM2711 (ARM Cortex-A72)


Which is helpful when comparing with various other utilities, like gcc, 
which take cortex-a72 as -mtune parameters.
