Hi,

I originally wrote the uuid implementation in util-linux.  Originally,
it was first in e2fsprogs, and then later the library was transferred
to util-linux at least for most Linux distributions.  Technically
speaking, however, libuuid is still shipped in the e2fsprogs sourecs
and that's the version which is used by Android and some non-Linux
OS's including NetBSD and Darwin (MacOS may have forked the library,
though, so if I shipped updates in e2fsprogs how quickly it would get
picked up by Apple.)  Libuuid is mostly in maintenance mode, actually;
the sort of changes that have landed recently have been to support the
getrandom(2) system call.

I'm not sure what the context is for this e-mail thread, or what
you're asking for in terms of an LGTM?  Were you looking for comments
on draft-ietf-uuidrev-rfc4122bis?  Or were you hoping to see if folks
might be interested in implementing the new UUID versions in
draft-ietf-uuidrev-rfc4122bis so the libuuid in Linux might support
those new variants?

Cheers,

					- Ted

P.S.  Hi Michael; long time no chat --- I haven't been to an IETF
meeting in many years!)
