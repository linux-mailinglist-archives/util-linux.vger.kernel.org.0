I had a discussion about it with Serge (in CC), it seems the current
the conclusion is that "for now shadow will have to keep shipping su".

The problem is not #ifdef, but that you need local reimplementation
for the very basic PAM functionality.                    

I have suggested creating some minimalistic library with PAM
compatible API, but without all the functionality. Maybe we can
develop this library in util-linux and later offer it to other
projects. Volunteers? ;-)
                                                         
Another possibility is to improve the original PAM to make it possible
to compile it without modules, etc.
