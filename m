My Name Mrs.Rose.Hersi


I am writing you base on your good profile. I am in search of
aproperty to buy in your country; I intended to come over to
youcountry for investment? I believe that I have to partner with a
citizen to be safe in investing in your country. My name is
Mrs.Rose.Hersi,My late husband deals on Crude Oil with Federal
Government of Sudan and we have a private Oil firm in Bentiu Oil zone
town and Upper Nile city.

What I have experience physically, I don't wish to experience it again
in my life due to the recent civil and Ethnic crises caused by our
President Mr.Salva Kiir and the rebel leader Mr. Riek Machar, I have
been Under United Nation refugee camp in Rue De Bass am west Africa,to
save my life and that of my little daughter

.I want to solicit for your partnership with trust to transfer and
invest with my fund deposited at Bank by my late husband,I will
disclose the Amount to you as we proceed.I need your help to move this
fund to your country,because my life is no longer safe in Africa,
since the rebels are looking for the families of all the oil business
partners in the country, very scaring I wish you will understand my
predicaments.


But the truth is that I and my daughter was lucky to be part of the bagde
taken by UN KEEPING FORCE to Addis Ababa our Neighboring country where
I WE BOARD to Abidjan Ivory Coast,We left Sudan and move to Addis
Ababa our neighboring country with the few days ceasefire which was
announced by United Nation Peace keeping Force., Because of face to
face peace meeting accord coordinated by US Secretary of State, and
United Nations in Ethiopia (Addis Ababa) between The sitting President
Mr. Salva Kiir and the rebel leader Mr. Riek Machar to stop this war.I
will send you the document of the fund with other details for your
acknowledgement and prove.

With love from

Mrs.Rose.Hersi
