It's not actually that it is creating holes, but rather it was fallouth
from switching ext4 to use iomap for FIBMAP/FIEMAP.

The following patch is queued up to be pushed to Linus shortly, and
will be backported to stable kernels.
 
Apologies for the inconvenience.  This would have been pushed to Linus
before 5.8 was cut, but an unrelated kernel bug that showed up after
5.8-rc1 and was causing very hard-to-reproduce memory corruptions
(although it was happening quite reliably in my test setup) caused my
regression testing to go completely dark for most of the 5.8-rcX
development, and by the time the bug was finally fixed (around -rc6 if
I remember correctly), I decided to wait until the 5.9 merge window.

    ext4: implement swap_activate aops using iomap
    
    After moving ext4's bmap to iomap interface, swapon functionality
    on files created using fallocate (which creates unwritten extents) are
    failing. This is since iomap_bmap interface returns 0 for unwritten
    extents and thus generic_swapfile_activate considers this as holes
    and hence bail out with below kernel msg :-
    
    [340.915835] swapon: swapfile has holes
    
    To fix this we need to implement ->swap_activate aops in ext4
    which will use ext4_iomap_report_ops. Since we only need to return
    the list of extents so ext4_iomap_report_ops should be enough.
