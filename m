Don't underestimate the dark side, Karel!
9s vs 41s (and an even bigger ratio on partial builds) is going to be
a strong pull.

Eh, I'd say that at this point meson (despite occasional small tweaks
required) is more stable than autotools. Right now autotools is stable
mostly because it doesn't change. With the upcoming update to
autoconf-2.71 that era is coming to an end.
