I guess you want "table" mode for the column (see --table-* options).
It provides almost all features from libsmartcols. The next important
thing for your use-case is --output-separator, for example

  $ echo "AAA BBB CCC" | ./column -t --output-separator "..."
  AAA...BBB...CCC

of course you can use "   " to define space as separator, etc.
