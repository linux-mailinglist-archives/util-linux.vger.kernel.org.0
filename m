Thanks for the details. Indeed I noticed sysfs_devno_is_dm_private()
skipping 'stratis-1-private' suffixed devices, but to be honest, their
functionality is opaque to me, I don't really know what they mean or how
they are used.
I got a report that mkfs.xfs stopped working for them, and my investigation
led to this subtle behavior change in blkid_new_probe_from_filename().

So, IIUC what you're saying, stratis shouldn't be using devices they
flag as private the way they are using, so I agree, and perhaps their
understanding of what a private device means is wrong and not using the
API properly.

On the other hand though -- playing The Devil's Advocate a bit --, this
is still a subtle API break and I don't think your patch is the right
way to fix the race you're seeing.

I honestly couldn't find any information about it, whether
blkid_new_probe_from_filename() could be used or not with private
devices, the only thing I really see (from a user perspective) was the
library call not working as before.

Also, reading what you explained above regarding the usage, I think I
was right when I said this is not the right way to fix the race you
mentioned. Because the race is still there, it is now just hidden for
LVM's specific use case.

Quoting libblkid documentation for blkid_new_probe_from_filename():

"
This function is same as call open(filename), blkid_new_probe()
and blkid_probe_set_device(pr, fd, 0, 0).
"

This was exactly how I "fixed" xfsprogs to allow Stratis behavior to
continue the way it is. Which by your explanation above is incorrect,
as is the same sequence call that you mentioned that should not be
allowed... open() the device then probe_set_device()... Which tells me
that any libblkid user following this same sequence is fundamentally
broken.

So, although I agree with you that Stratis is using libblkid incorrectly,
I still think this patch is wrong, as it changes the library's behavior
to fix a problem in LVM (if there is where the race was), and not some
inherent library problem. If, no user can use libblkid to query into a
private device, then the above lib call sequence wasn't supposed to work
either, and perhaps then, blkid_probe_set_device() should actually fail
in a private device.

Again, I just looked into the libblkid low-level implementation today,
but it doesn't seem to be the library's job to be responsible for a race
between open() and ioctl(DM_DEVICE_REMOVE).

Cheers,
Carlos
