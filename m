Dear Sir/Madam

I won the Powerball lottery of $150Million on November 2, 2019 and I have voluntarily decided to donate the sum of $10Million to charity, I try to reach people randomly from different sources and modes so as to touch lives from different angles, Hence you are getting a message here.

You have been listed as one of the lucky recipients to receive $2M This donation is made out to you so to enable you strengthen your personal issues and mostly to generously help us extend hands of giving to the less privileged, orphans and charity organizations within your locality

To verify

Get back to me on how to receive the donation

Thanks
Bill Lawrence
