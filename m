Please add information provided by Nathan.

Minor nit below.

> +#ifdef CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTREMOVE
> +	return sprintf(buf, "1\n");
> +#else
> +	return sprintf(buf, "0\n");
> +#endif
	int ret = IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTREMOVE);

	return sprintf(buf, "%d\n", ret)

would be slightly nicer than explicit ifdefs.
