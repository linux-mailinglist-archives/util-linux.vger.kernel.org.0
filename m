There is no guaranty that the UUID will be the upper or lower case
although in fstab.5 and mount.8 man pages we have "should be based on
lower case characters".                                            
                                                                   
libblkid itself does not modify UUID/PARTUUID when reading it from the
filesystem. It depends on FS-specific prober in the library or in some
cases on the filesystem superblock if UUID is stored as a string there.

And it's also important to support 3rd party UUID from another source as
you can write whatever to your udev rules and use others tools to get
UUIDs.     
                                                                   
So, I think your request to compare UUIDs in a case-insensitive way
makes sense. The library should be smart enough to accept whatever.


I'll think about it and try to improve the current situation.

 Karel
