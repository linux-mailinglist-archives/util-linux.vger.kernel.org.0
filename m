I've fixed most of the issues in my Github fork; see pull request
#1601. However, there's something left (my comments are in brackets):

--
Man page: hexdump.1
Issue:    superfluous citation around markup

"Output characters in the default character set. Non-printing characters ar=
e "
"displayed as a single \\(aqB<.>\\(aq."

"Further output by such format strings is replaced by an equivalent number =
of "
"spaces. An equivalent number of spaces is defined as the number of spaces =
"
"output by an B<s> conversion character with the same field width and "
"precision as the original conversion character or conversion string but wi=
th "
"any \\(aqB<+>\\(aq, \\(aq \\(aq, \\(aqB<#>\\(aq conversion flag characters=
 "
"removed, and referencing a NULL string."

(I think it's better to keep the citation here to keep the dot apart
from the sentence ending, otherwise we get "..")
--
Man page: hwclock.8
Issue:    date-time =E2=86=92 date time??

"There are two types of date-time clocks:"

(We have lots of occurences of this "date-time" thing. Don't know
whether it's good English or bad English =E2=80=A6)
--
Man page: lsmem.1
Issue:    The first sentence is broken

"The B<lsmem> command lists a new memory range always when the current memo=
ry "
"block distinguish from the previous block by some output column. This "
"default behavior is possible to override by the B<--split> option (e.g., "
"B<lsmem --split=3DZONES>). The special word \"none\" may be used to ignore=
 all "
"differences between memory blocks and to create as large as possible "
"continuous ranges. The opposite semantic is B<--all> to list individual "

(Not sure what this means. I can't remember anymore why I wrote this
comment more than three years ago =E2=80=A6)
--
Man page: mount.8
Issue:    ftp://ftp.namesys.com/pub/reiserfsprogs does not allow login

"A remount option which permits online expansion of reiserfs partitions. "
"Instructs reiserfs to assume that the device has I<number> blocks. This "
"option is designed for use with devices which are under logical volume "
"management (LVM). There is a special I<resizer> utility which can be "
"obtained from"

(The link gives a 404 error. I found a similar tool in the kernel
wiki: https://reiser4.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Resize_reiserfs)
--
Man page: scriptreplay.1
Issue:    output doesn't match the real output exactly

"% script --log-timing file.tm --log-out script.out\n"
"Script started, file is script.out\n"
"% ls\n"
"E<lt>etc, etcE<gt>\n"
"% exit\n"
--
Man page: setarch.8
Issue:    arch =E2=86=92 setarch?

"B<arch> [options] [I<program> [I<argument>...]]"

(Is "arch" still a synonym for "setarch"? With --help, I don't get "arch".)
----
Man page: unshare.1
Issue:    B<sleep> =E2=86=92 B<sleep>(1)

"The B<pidof>(1) command prints no output, because the B<sleep> processes "
"have been killed. More precisely, when the B<sleep> process that has PID 1=
 "
"in the namespace (i.e., the namespace\\(cqs init process) was killed, this=
 "
"caused all other processes in the namespace to be killed. By contrast, a "
"similar series of commands where the B<--kill-child> option is not used "
"shows that when B<unshare> terminates, the processes in the PID namespace =
"
"are not killed:"

(It's not about the "sleep" command, rather the processes; don't think it's
needed here to link to the man page.)

Your comments are welcome.
