Yes, I'm not sure about AsciiDoc limitations. For example systemd guys uses
DocBook which is probably ultimate solution.

The idea is maintain documentation (in git tree) in some content
oriented language and then generate man pages from this content. It
means in the official release tarball will be man pages and end-users
will not see any difference.

The issue I have with man pages is that contributor very often send
patches to change formatting details and keep it consistent, avoid
color-of-bike-shed discussions is very difficult. It would be better
care about content and keep all the formatting details in some
conversion template.
