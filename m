No worries Aur=C3=A9lien, the year header is an unresolved (for me)
discussion from long ago. When I take time to make, what seems like, a
logical argument for a change and only get subjective or fiat responses
it makes my head explode or something. I like coding because it is
logical, I guess that is the way I'm wired.

* the same issue is present for 11 months and 13 months. What makes 12
   months special?

* it scrolls off the screen leaving the viewer with unknowable information=
.

I just think the output is far more functional if the year is always
visible. For locales with long month names that would wrap, use
abbreviated month names and/or 2 digit year. Worst case, use numerical
month label for such locales. What do those locales do now for 13 months?
Is there a locale that breaks the current 13 month output?

Well, that is my complaint of choosing form over function.

No need for that; the upstream changes I attempt to make are not for me.
The cal(1) on my system does exactly what I want it to do (including
telling me when it switches to an entirely different calendar system).

I have not used ncal; didn't even know about it, to be honest.

Anyway Aur=C3=A9lien, pay no attention to me; carry on with your work. I'm
done now.
