It's a little bit more complex. It's not just about rootfs. The reason
why udevd scans all the devices is to create a udev database and fill
it with data usable for running the system. For example, when you type
'lsblk --fs', it reads the data from the database (findmnt, mount,
etc.), which is also used by udev rules and for dependency evaluations
in systemd, etc. This is the reason why the system gathers all the
data about a new device when it's detected.

If you want to avoid all of this, you need to customize udev rules
where you can filter out what and how to scan.

You're on the right track. PARTLABEL and PARTUUID are stored in the
partition table, so it's unnecessary to scan partitions for their
content (filesystems).

Yes, using blkid_dev_devname() is not advisable. It's part of the old
high-level libblkid API from the pre-udev era.

If you truly need to read data from the device, then utilizing the
low-level probing API is recommended. This can be done from the
command line with 'blkid -p', but you'll need to disable scanning for
all unwanted data (using '--usage no*'). For instance:

    blkid -o udev -p --usages nofilesystem,raid,crypto,others /dev/sda1

This command will only return ID_PART_ENTRY_* data from the partition
table.

You can use the LIBBLKID_DEBUG=all environment variable to see
the library's operations.

The question arises whether using blkid is the ideal solution if you
only require PARTLABELs and PARTUUIDs. For example, sfdisk could be a
more efficient approach:

    sfdisk -l /dev/sda -o+NAME,UUID

However, a potential issue is that sfdisk only provides the guessed
partition names (paths); the name used by the kernel might be different.

It depends on your goal. You can heavily customize your system to
speed up boot (all the necessary tools are available for this
purpose). However, the problem I see is the issue of portability and
the maintenance overhead.
