The cgroup behavior actually works like system. It is a constraint of your max
allowed util_min/max value. There's an exception to that where cgroup will
behave like '-p'...

I avoided commenting on cgroup behavior here. I plan to send a patch to
document util clamp in the kernel. For this tool since we don't interact with
cgroup I omitted talking about it.

I intend to send a patch documenting util clamp in the kernel. I think It's
better to discuss this details there?

Hopefully it'll become common knowledge at some point..

Thanks for having a look.
