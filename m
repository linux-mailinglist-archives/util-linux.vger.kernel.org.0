This is bug. MBR probing code in fdisk is weak and it does not check for 
false positives like blkid, so FAT32 is interpreted as MBR and the bootbits
are not wiped (fdisk wipes first sector only if it creates a new
partition table).

In another case like

  # dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sdc bs=512 count=1
  # hexdump -C -n 512 /dev/sdc
  # fdisk /dev/sdc                 (...create MBR)

  # hexdump -C -n 512 /dev/sdc
